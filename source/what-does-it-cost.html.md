What does it cost to publish an online collection catalogue? This is one of the most frequent questions that the Getty Foundation gets asked about OSCI, and it is hard to answer. The OSCI projects were diverse by design, and the costs to produce them varied widely depending on the scope, scale, and ambition of the catalogue project, as well as the size and content of the collection. Some of the participating partners needed additional staffing, others had sufficient in-house capacity. Some OSCI projects required large technology investments, others did not. In short, there is no clear way to compare apples to apples.

Getty Foundation grants for the planning phase of the OSCI projects ranged from $140,700 to $240,000, with an average of $218,000. Subsequent implementation grants ranged from $197,000 to $495,000, with an average of $316,500. The combined total given to individual museums during the life of the initiative ranged from $377,700 to $735,000, with an average of $537,400. The OSCI museums also contributed to the costs of their catalogues, ranging from $123,000 to over $590,000.

This compares to typical cmuseum thatfor average of Sales income can offset some of the costs of development and production, though most publishers note that there is a shrinking market for these catalogues due to reduced library sales and other factors.

At this point, we can’t predict with certainty whether a museum’s initial investment in online publishing will pay off.

However, early results from the OSCI partners who have published or will soon release additional catalogues suggest that costs can be significant reduced for subsequent volumes, by as much as 50% or more.
